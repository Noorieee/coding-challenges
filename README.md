#  Code Challenges

Hi! I'm Noor, and this repo is a growing collection of React components I'm building as part of coding challenges, design explorations, and UI experiments.

The goal? To sharpen my front-end skills, explore reusable patterns, and bridge the gap between **design and development** using React + Figma.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside

- A variety of **React components** – some based on references, others fully custom designed by me  
- Styled and documented using **Storybook**  
- Designed in **Figma** (mockups coming soon!)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (Create React App)  
- Storybook  
- Figma (for mockups & design)  
- Custom domain for live preview
- Hosted on Netlify

```

## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate and eager designer with a strong focus on crafting thoughtful, user-first digital experiences. My background blends **product and UX/UI design** with **front-end development**, allowing me to bridge the gap between beautiful interfaces and functional code.

While my core passion lies in design, I'm continuously levelling up my technical skills — currently learning **TypeScript** and deepening my React knowledge — to better collaborate with dev teams and bring ideas to life with precision.

Thanks for checking out my work!
